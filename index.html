// Base class for Actor
function Actor(){ }

// Set some of Actor's properties
Actor.prototype = { x: 0, y: 0 };

// Could also set them this way...
Actor.prototype.z = 0;


// Create an instance of this class
var Mike = new Actor();

if( Mike.x == 0 )
	document.write("Mike.x is 0, inherited from Actor prototype.\n");

if( !Mike.hasOwnProperty("x") )
	document.write("Mike has NO property X of its own, only the inherited one.\n");


// Now try overriding a property
Mike.x = 7;

if( Mike.x == 7 )
	document.write("Mike.x is 7, overriden from Actor prototype.\n");

if( Mike.hasOwnProperty("x") )
	document.write("Mike has property X of its own now.\n");


// Now try removing the property from Mike
delete Mike.x;

if( Mike.x == 0 )
	document.write("Mike.x is 0 again because it is no longer overridden.\n");


// Now create a child class NPC that inherits from Actor and also adds some new properties
function NPC(){ }

// Set some of NPC's unique properties
NPC.prototype = new Actor();
NPC.prototype.IsScared = true;

var John = new NPC();

if( John.IsScared )
	document.write("John has its new property.\n");

if( John.x == 0 )
	document.write("John has the property X inherieted from Actor.\n");
